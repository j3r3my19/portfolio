# Portfolio

Hello! My name is Jeremy, and I'm excited to share my still developing data portfolio. You can find here different projects either from my studies or from my free time!

## [Nine Game](https://github.com/j3r3my19/nine_game)

A local multiuser card game coded in Python using Tkinter library. You can find the rules here ! 

## [The future of wind energy in France](https://github.com/tristanGIANDO/jedha_final_project)

During my ML Engineer degree final project, I worked with 3 others students on a way to decide where to implements future wind project in France in the coming years. To do that we gathered data from differents sources, we trained a SARIMAX Machine Learning model to predict wind speed within 7 years and created a map to visualize the results. 

You can access the map [here](https://tristangiando.github.io/jedha_final_project/jedha_final_project/map/app_flask/final_map.html)
